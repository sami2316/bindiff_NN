#### BinDiff_NN: Learning Distributed Representation of Assembly for Robust Binary Diffing against Semantic Differences

Install the dependencies and Python3 to run code. The details instructions for
installation are comming soon. 

*Briefly*
1. Extract the features database (comming soon..). We could not upload the pre-
   extracted assembly data, you can message us until we upload the code. 
2. Run the `python3 main.py` to train the network.
3. For prediction model, first get run the `parser_prediction.py` to generate
   model ready input. 
4. Run `test_model.py` to get the prediction model. 


*Feature extration code is comming soon due to copyright issues*
